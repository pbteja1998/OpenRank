# Open Rank Documentation 

We are using [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for managing documentation.

The only directories that needs to be changed are `/docs` and `/website`

```bash
# Navigate to website directory
$ cd website

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# To view the website locally
$ npm run start
```
The website will be opened automatically in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
